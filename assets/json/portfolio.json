    "shortDescription": "<p>Dr. Livingstone, I suppose? is a Premium Indie title that I co-founded and still support as a developer and co-producer. It is a mix between a puzzle and FPP adventure game with a strong emphasis on the story. The action takes place in nineteenth-century Africa, when Henry Stanley is sent to search for a missing explorer - David Livingstone.</p><p>The game was built entirely in Unreal Engine 4 using C ++ and Blueprints. Working as a game programmer from the very beginning required many prototypes, especially the mechanics of individual puzzles. At the same time, I worked in a team of 2-3 people on player movement and environmental aspects - for example opening doors and drawers. One of the main pillars of the game is to reflect the player's natural movement during free exploration. Therefore, for example, cabinet doors are not opened with a click or button press, but with a mouse movement reflecting the actual movement of the hand when opening the door. Later, the basic mechanics were grouped into separate components to speed up the process of creating individual puzzles. My personal success with this project is the code architecture for UI, which solved the problems with displaying various puzzle widgets.</p><p>I work closely with game designers all the time to make sure my work is consistent with their ideas. I help them navigate the UE4 editor while tweaking parameters or testing the game.</p><p><a href=\"https://livingstone-game.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Release date on Steam: Q2 2021</a></p>"

AI tanks use NavMesh to follow the Player and inside logic to shoot efficiently. A player plays his tank as he likes :) Arena was sculptured with UE Landscape Tools. Particles were modified from UE basic content.</p>"

Made me appreciate game engines :)</p><p>The goal of the game is to catch four birds (yellow ball), the next bird spawns randomly in the city after the previous one is hit. Height and number of buildings are generated from a file. Birds AI fly around the city using Blackboards. Collisions were built from scratch. The bullet physics were designed and implemented with pure math and Newton physics. Skybox and some textures were added for more pleasant gameplay. The game produces a verbose log file.</p>"
